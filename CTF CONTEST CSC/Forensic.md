because this challenge is a forensic challenge, i quickly put it in [aperisolve](https://www.aperisolve.com/45e6cbbb61c5d191a0461e500c833be5) to check if there is something interesting in this photo.
At first, there was nothing interesting but when i check binwalk report, there are several files inside this photo.

I fire up my kali linux and extract the photo with the command `binwalk -e chaewonn.png`

when check into the extracted directory, i found a `ch.txt` file which when i `cat` the file, i got a base64 encoded string

I take the base64 to cyberchef to decode it which then gave me the flag of this challenge
