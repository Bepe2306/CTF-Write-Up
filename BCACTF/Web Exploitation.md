in the description of the challenge i was given a tip by the probset which is `Pro tip: Zoom out!`, i also just realized that i could actually zoom in and out and scroll up and down, when i zoom out and scrolled down, i could see that there are many clue for the flag
which represented in sea animal picture which could be clicked and get into other directory

### **SHARK**

In the Shark directory, i was given a website that looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/9f1cee7c-eb06-4013-8ac9-7f02372395a2)

from the clue given in the shark page, i quickly think that the part of the flag is hidden in the source code. So then i just view source code of the shark web which then brought me to the part 1 of the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/19572f5d-fc4e-4b8c-b825-3057e493e06d)

**PART 1 FLAG:** `<!-- You found the shark! Part 1 of the flag: "bcactf{b3" -->`

### **SQUID**

In the squid directory, the web page looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/458f00b5-6757-45d6-bde6-c4300b8b2252)

Since in the Shark web, i found the flag part in the source code, so i just ignore the clue given in the webpage and immediately view the page source code.
In the page source code, when i analyze it, i found a js script which when i entered, i found the second part of the flag

**PART 2 FLAG:** `console.log("You found it! Here's the second part of the flag: \"t_y0u_d1\"");`

### **CLAM**

In the clam directory, the web page looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/a986585b-4a21-4f64-a599-6593175c4b90)

Again, just like part 1 and 2 flag, i just check the source code of the web page and do scanning which brought me to the js script and inside the js script, i found the part 3 of the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/145c61be-8f24-409d-af2c-7a2c92652427)

**PART 3 FLAG:** `flag part 3:=dnt_f1n`

### **SHIPWRECK**

In the Shipwreck directory, the web page looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/e3682238-b3be-4b72-b6cd-c2d0f8ad3934)

taking an experience from the previous flag parts, i tried to look at the web page source code and scan the code, found a js script which when i look inside, there was no flag could be found but there was a clue which is `Hint: Check the response headers`. 

From this hint, i quickly fire up my burpsuite to intercept the website, which then brought me to the fourth part of the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/cd3f5ba7-aa21-4237-9c10-7a3ea26cb319)

**PART 4 FLAG:** `Flag_Part_4: d_th3_tr`

### **WHALE**

In the Whale directory, the web page looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/4e6c0a76-7305-46fa-b592-f0b4f1a69ae4)

just like the previous part of the flag, i check the source code of the web page and do scanning on the code which again give me the js script and inside the js script i found the part 5 of the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/285662b0-b816-4da1-8eea-7624a423ed56)

**PART 5 FLAG:** `// Part 5 of the flag: "e4sur3"`

`TREASURE`

At this part, i thought the flag had only 5 parts, when i tried to submitted it, the flag was incorrect, i tried to analyze the very first web page by viewing the web page source code. It turns out that there is another directory hidden in the web page called `Treasure`.

When i opened the web page, it looks like this

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/7f5d7369-36b8-4df9-8c2b-fb582af3ef23)

again just like the previous part, i open the source code and do a scanning on the code which then brought me to a javascript file. When i opened it i found another clue for the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/d22e0881-3afa-44a2-8b04-1d0a7914ec1b)

it seems that this part of the flag must be find by using `robots.txt` at the back of the url which when i added it, it gave me the rest of the flag

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/2d9c8590-f34c-493c-8a7e-715c96038a6e)

**PART 6 FLAG:** `You found the rest of the flag! _t336e3}`

**FLAG:** `bcactf{b3t_y0u_d1dnt_f1nd_th3_tre4sur3_t336e3}`
