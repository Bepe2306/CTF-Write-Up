in the description of the challenge i was given a tip by the probset which is `Pro tip: Zoom out!`, i also just realized that i could actually, when i zoom out, i could see that there are many clue for the flag
which represented in sea animal picture which could be clicked and get into other directory

`SHARK`

In the Shark directory, i was given a website that looks like this

from the clue given in the shark page, i quickly think that the part of the flag is hidden in the source code. So then i just view source code of the shark web which then brought me to the part 1 of the flag

**PART 1 FLAG:** `<!-- You found the shark! Part 1 of the flag: "bcactf{b3" -->`

`SQUID`

In the squid directory, the web page looks like this

Since in the Shark web, i found the flag part in the source code, so i just ignore the clue given in the webpage and immediately view the page source code.
In the page source code, when i analyze it, i found a js script which when i entered, i found the second part of the flag

**PART 2 FLAG:** `console.log("You found it! Here's the second part of the flag: \"t_y0u_d1\"");`

Again, just like part 1 and 2 flag, i just check the source code of the web page and do scanning which brought me to the js script and inside the js script, i found the part 3 of the flag

just like the previous part of the flag, i check the source code of the web page and do scanning on the code which again give me the js script and inside the js script i found the part 5 of the flag

**PART 5 FLAG:** `// Part 5 of the flag: "e4sur3"`
