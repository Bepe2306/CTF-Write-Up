# **Countries Unite**

"yoshie" sent me a peculiar message. What could he possibly be trying to say?

**Solution:**

In this challenge i was given a picture consist of many flags

![countries](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/cc7613f5-0423-496f-b4cf-c936543a58fa)

It's quite simple, i just need to get the first letter of each country flag to get the challenge flag

FLAG: `bronco{diveristyequityinclusion}`
