In this challenge, i was given a website that look like the picture below

When i tried to open `list_processes` i see something interesting in the url

i see that there is a `command=` in the url which can be a vulnerability that i could exploit

Since this challenge provide a source code, i tried to the source code to see the workflow of the website

`main.py`

`destroy_humans.sh`

Based on two source codes above, after i analyze it, i can understand that `command` in the url can take another argument `Destroy Humans` directory.
I just need to find the way how to add another argument

I got recommended by my friend to use `&` so there can be two argument parse into the url, just like in the main.py source code

After reading another source called `destroyer.py`

i can see that i can find the flag from `/shutdown` directory.
Since there is a `curl` command in the destroy_human.sh file where it will curl another directory that are also in destroyer.py file, so then i just tried to use the curl command but change the directory
to `/shutdown`, So the command will be `?command=destroy_humans&arg=curl%20-s%20localhost:3000/shutdown` which brought me to the flag of the challenge

**FLAG:** `SIVBGR{g00dby3_ARI4}`


# **Hunt**

In this challenge i was given a web that look like the picture below

![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/78a501f5-8bac-4d3d-b0bb-d02c50f357d7)

When i try to analyze the web, it looks like the web is all about robots. From here i got the clue to do `robots.txt` to the website url, which when i did it, it gave me the second part of the flag

**Second Part of Flag:** `p2: 0f_th3_`

When i look at that page, i realized that there is another url called `/secret-bot-spot`, i tried to enter the url but there is nothing interesting.
But then, i had an idea, i tried to view the page source of this web but still there is nothing interesting.

From here i tried to skim the code just to have a check if there is something interesting which then brought me to a js script url. I tried to analyze the js script to see if there is any clue can be found from there which then gave me the third part of the flag

**Third Part of Flag:** `p3: r0b0ts!}`

Since i have found the second and third part of the flag, i was a bit confused to find the first part of the flag, but then i suddenly had an idea. Since the third part of the flag can be found when i view the page source, so i think i need to check the page source of the very first web that i get.

When i analyze the source code, it gave me the first part of the flag

**First Part of Flag:** `p1: SIVBGR{r1s3_`

**FLAG:** `SIVBGR{r1s3_0f_th3_r0b0ts!}`
