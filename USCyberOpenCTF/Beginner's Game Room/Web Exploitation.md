In this challenge, i was given a website that look like the picture below

When i tried to open `list_processes` i see something interesting in the url

i see that there is a `command=` in the url which can be a vulnerability that i could exploit

Since this challenge provide a source code, i tried to the source code to see the workflow of the website

`main.py`

`destroy_humans.sh`
![image](https://github.com/Bepe2306/CTF-Write-Up/assets/153899054/c0e3b4f9-8242-47b8-9491-c4c4d78e859d)

Based on two source codes above, after i analyze it, i can understand that `command` in the url can take another argument `Destroy Humans` directory.
I just need to find the way how to add another argument

I got recommended by my friend to use `&` so there can be two argument parse into the url, just like in the main.py source code

After reading another source called `destroyer.py`

i can see that i can find the flag from `/shutdown` directory.
Since there is a `curl` command in the destroy_human.sh file where it will curl another directory that are also in destroyer.py file, so then i just tried to use the curl command but change the directory
to `/shutdown`, So the command will be `?command=destroy_humans&arg=curl%20-s%20localhost:3000/shutdown` which brought me to the flag of the challenge

**FLAG:** `SIVBGR{g00dby3_ARI4}`
