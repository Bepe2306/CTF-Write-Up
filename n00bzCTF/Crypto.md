# **Vinegar**

in this challenge, i was given a enc.txt file that has encrypted flag and the key

`Encrypted flag: nmivrxbiaatjvvbcjsf`

`Key: secretkey`

Based on my experience and the name of the challenge which is called Vinegar, i know that this challenge require viginere decoder in order to get the flag of the challenge.
So then i use a viginere decoder from [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher)

I put in the flag and the key which brings me to the flag of the challenge
