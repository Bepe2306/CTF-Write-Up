# **Passwordless**

in this challenge, i got help from two of my teammates, so thanks a lot for them

In the challenge i was given an `app.py` file and `a link to a website`

`app.py`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88069f0c-b66e-4b77-b46c-d31d5d488588)

`http://24.199.110.35:40150/`

From the given `app.py` i could understand how the system flow works, but i still needed to do some inspection into the website to know it better

if i input `admin123` as username

if i input `user` as username

notice that in the url of the `user` username, something is a bit different which has sort of like encrypted id.

I look back at the source code, it turns out to be an `uuid.uuid5` with a `leet key` mix with the `username`


`uuid.uuid5 : uid = uuid.uuid5(leet,username)`

`leet key: leet=uuid.UUID('13371337-1337-1337-1337-133713371337')`

from this point, my friend told me to understand what uuid or uuid5 is.

**Short explanation:**

UUID5 or UUID is used to generate random id taken from the uuid library as well with the key that can be used to encrypt or decrypt which means that the same input will always produce the same output.

So then i understand that in the link (`http://24.199.110.35:40150/28a699ac-8bc0-558d-b8f7-5df8ce22cbb4`), the random number was generated from the uuid algorithm

So using the key that i have and the username of `admin123`, i tried to make a script that will make random generated id (uuid) for `admin123`

when i run it, i got the uuid

when i replace the previous uuid with the `admin123` uuid, i got the flag of the challenge

**FLAG:** `n00bz{1337-13371337-1337-133713371337-1337}`
