in this challenge i was given a picture like the one below

i tried to search it with google image but i could not find anything.
I tried to search it on google with the keyword `airline with flower on tail`.

There are a few of them, but there is one whose tail is exactly the same as in the given picture

Since the challenge ask for a code, i search for `Air Tahiti Nui airline code` and found something

Since i have found the IATA and the ICAO code with the Airline code, i just use [flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/) to get more information since it will give me a very detailed information about an airline.

Using the IATA code, i can find the amount of fleet Air Tahiti Nui have

So then i search the first one with the registration `F-OMUA` i could see the flight history of the plane

From here it is a bit of guessing game since if i want to find the airline's hub i must find the airport where they mostly operate from, but there are several airports where they operate quite often
like `Seattle (SEA)`, `Papeete (PPT)` and `Los Angeles (LAX)` but it turns out the `Papeete` is the answer for this challenge
