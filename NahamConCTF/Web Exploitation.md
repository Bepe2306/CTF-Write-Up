# **All About Robots**

In this challenge i was given a link to a website. Inside the website there are some brief explanations about some robots nothing seems really interesting

I already get the clue by the name of this challenge which is `robots`. So i add `robots.txt` to the back of the url which gave me this result

At first, i was confused about the url given from the robots.txt because i thought this will be some kind of SQL injection so the website will spill out the data from its directory.

But then i was thinking, why if i replace the /robots.txt url with the url given. So then i fire away and turns out it brought me to the flag of this challenge
